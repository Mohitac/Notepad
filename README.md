# Notepad
This is a simple text editor that work like "the notepad application". This is a learning project as I am new to Java and programming.
Very basic features and must have menus have already been implemented.
Few features involved:
*Word Wraping
*Font Styling
*Cut, Copy, Paste
*Print
*Find and Replace
and a few more.
If you feel that you want to work on it and improve it then most welcome.
